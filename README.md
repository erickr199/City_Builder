# City Builder 
A demo of a medieval city builder game using Unity programmed on C# in which the player can place and upgrade buildings on a 9x9 grid. Each building can be upgraded 3 times and generate resources to be able to create new buildings. This demo was developed during a workshop hosted by Vancouver Film School
